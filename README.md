# RestServicePython
Python Worker-Manager distributed system for calculating code complexity

This python code requires a few dependecies in order to run, most notably Dask and Radon. 
If you do not currently have these installed on python you can add both of them via pip as so:
    
    pip install radon
    
    pip stall dask
    
You will also need Dask.Distributed, which can be installed as below:

    pip install dask distributed
